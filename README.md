# Shape Factory ~ Global Game Jam 2022 Entry

Shape Factory is an exciting 2 player factory matching game. Grab a friend and have fun racing to match all your shapes first! 

#### Rules: 

- Shapes placed on the main conveyor belt must match the color or shape of the currently displayed shape above. 
- If it doesn't match, you'll get a penalty, and more shapes will be added to your count.
- The shape and color you must match with will update and change to the shape or color of any valid shapes entered in. 
- If none of your shapes match, you can go to the button at the top of your play area and press it to generate a new, random shape (but this will increase your block count, so use it wisely). 
- The first player to match all of their shapes wins! 

#### Controls: 

- Blue Player/Left Player: WASD keys to move Space Bar to pick up/put down blocks, and push buttons 
- Red Player/Right Player: Arrow keys to move Zero (on Num Pad) to pick up/put down blocks, and push buttons

#### Challenges

- This was Andrea's first game jam, but she did a great job with the level design and art work.  The game turned out looking really nice!
- This is a 2 player / split screen game only.  It would be nice to create some AI so you could play against the computer.
- The theme of the game jam was Duality, our idea, was to be able to flip shapes over on the conveyor belt to turn them into sabotages, but we ran out of time and didn't get that implemented.
